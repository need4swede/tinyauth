# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Please always use the latest available Tinyauth version which can be found [here](https://github.com/steveiliop56/tinyauth/releases/latest). Older versions (especially major) may contain security issues which I cannot go back and fix.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Due to the nature of this app, it needs to be secure. If you find any security issues in the OAuth or login flow of the app please contact me at <steve@doesmycode.work> and include a concise description of the issue. Please do not use the issues section for reporting major security issues.
